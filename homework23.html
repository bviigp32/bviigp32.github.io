    <td>By EMMANUEL ROMERO L.A Cicero Richard Zare PRofessor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer grass that tickels your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries secial chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance are form, where they traveled and what happened to them along the way, But doing these analyses has been complex and costly, Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new method to make isotopic analysis easer and less expensive</td>
